# QR-algorithm
QR alogrithm for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large symmetric matrices.
The algorithm runs on a 800*800 matrix from the included txt file-inv_matrix(800 x 800). 
There are implementations of the algorithm in 2 languages: Python and Haskell.
Optimization was used to speed up the algorithm.
The algorithm's runtime on both languages is about 1 minute.
